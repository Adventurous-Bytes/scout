# Contributing to Scout Core

## Repository

The Scout project is hosted at: https://github.com/Adventurous-Bytes/scout

## Prerequisites

1. Node.js (version 18 or higher)
2. [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) package manager
3. Familiarity with react and redux

## Development Setup

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adventurous-Bytes/scout.git
cd scout

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration
```


#### Subsystems

- **Hooks**: Located in `core/hooks/` for data fetching and real-time updates
- **Types**: Located in `core/types/` for TypeScript definitions
- **Helpers**: Located in `core/helpers/` for API interactions
- **Store**: Located in `core/store/` for Redux state management

#### Type Generation

When the database schema changes, update types:

```bash
# Generate updated Supabase types
supabase gen types typescript --project-id "nfgpianoyribtvkqbjeq" --schema public > core/types/supabase.ts
```

## Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch from `main` - for example `feat/new-feature
3. **Test** your changes in a Next.js application (TODO: make it easier to test in operating environment)
4. **Update** [documentation](https://github.com/Adventurous-Bytes/scout/tree/main/docs) if needed
5. **Submit** a pull request with clear description of changes and Testing

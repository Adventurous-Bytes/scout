# Scout Sync Engine Guide

The Scout Sync Engine is a robust synchronization system that manages bidirectional data flow between local SQLite storage and the remote Scout server. It handles hierarchical data relationships, batch operations, and provides resilient error handling.

## Overview

The sync engine maintains a strict hierarchical sync order to preserve data integrity:

1. **Sessions** (parent entities)
2. **Connectivity** entries (children of sessions)
3. **Events** (children of sessions)
4. **Tags** (children of events)

This order ensures that parent entities are synced before their children, preventing foreign key constraint violations.

## Key Features

- **Batch Operations**: Efficiently syncs multiple items in single requests
- **Automatic ID Management**: Handles local-to-remote ID mapping and relationship updates
- **Partial Failure Recovery**: Continues syncing other entities even if one type fails
- **Configurable Batching**: Control sync frequency and batch sizes

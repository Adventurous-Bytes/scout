## Installing Rust Toolchain
Scout is written in Rust, so that we can leverage the language's type safety and tooling. To get started with Rust, you should install the Rust toolchain with the following command. This Rust toolchain will help you run Rust programs and tap into helpful utilities like cargo.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

For more information on Rust, visit the Rust Bible](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).
